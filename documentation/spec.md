# KoloTV Bot Mention Tracking Project Specification

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a Telegram bot to track mentions of specific words in various Telegram chats. The bot is created at the request of an Kolo.TV Internet provider to monitor mentions of the provider's company. The primary objectives are to improve customer experience and expedite responses from technical support.

## User Roles
- Managers: Team members who can access and manage the bot's settings.
- Support Service: Team members who respond to detected mentions.

## Core Features
- Mention Tracking:
  - The bot identifies mentions of specific words using regular expressions (regex).
  - When a mention is detected, it sends a notification to a designated technical chat.
  - Notifications include the mention text and a link to the original message.

- Statistics:
  - Managers can request statistics on mentions by sending the `/stats` command to the bot in private messages.
  - Statistics include the number of mentions for different words over specific time periods.

## Technical Stack
- Programming Language: Python 3.11
- Libraries/Frameworks:
  - aiogram 3.*
  - pydantic 2.*
  - python-dotenv 
  - sqlalchemy 2.*
  - Official Telegram API for receiving updates and sending notifications
- Database: SQLite (sqlite3)

## Deployment and Hosting
The application is deployed on a server provided by the customer. No further support or maintenance will be provided by the development team.

## Authorization
Additional authorization mechanisms beyond Telegram's built-in authentication are not implemented.

## User Interaction
Apart from the `/stats` command, no other user interactions are available at this time.

## Error Handling
The code includes try-except blocks for error handling within the application.

## Performance Optimization
Specific performance optimization strategies are employed, especially when dealing with large volumes of data.

## Version Control
The bot code is stored in a private GitHub repository for version control and collaboration among developers.

## Deployment Instructions
Deployment instructions are provided for the customer to set up the bot on their server.

## License and Ownership
Ownership and licensing terms of the code and project are defined in accordance with the customer's expectations.

## Project Closure
The project closure process includes the handover of code, documentation, and necessary credentials or access.
